### Trash Detection Feature with Cleaning Time Estimation

CleanLoop is a project focused on detecting trash in images and estimating the cleaning time required for the identified areas. This feature leverages **YOLOv8**, along with **Cloudinary** and **Imagga** APIs, to process, recognize, and tag trash in sample images, offering a visual representation of detected areas alongside an estimation of cleaning time.

This project was developed at the **SFSCON Hackathon (Nov 2024),  Bolzano, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹**. Learn more about the event [here](https://hackathon.bz.it/).

## Features

- **Trash Detection**: Identifies and tags trash in images using the YOLOv8 model, optimized for real-time object detection.
- **Cleaning Time Estimation**: Calculates an estimated cleaning time based on detected trash areas.
- **Cloud Storage and Management**: Utilizes Cloudinary for image hosting and management.

## Estimation Algorithm

The project uses an algorithm designed to estimate cleaning time by analyzing the tagged trash areas within the image.
